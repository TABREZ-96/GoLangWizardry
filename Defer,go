//Go provides the defer keyword to schedule a function call to be executed at the end of the current function, regardless of whether an error occurred or not. This is often used for cleanup or resource management.
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("This will be executed last.")
    fmt.Println("This will be executed first.")
    panic("Something went wrong!") // This will trigger a panic
}
